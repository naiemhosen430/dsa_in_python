in this repository, I am going to explain about DSA

What is Dsa?
-> DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. In programming, it's the art of efficiently organizing and manipulating data using specialized formats (data structures) and step-by-step procedures (algorithms). Choosing the right data structure and algorithm is crucial for writing efficient and effective programs. It's a fundamental concept in computer science and a key skill for programmers, influencing the speed and scalability of software solutions.
